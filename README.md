📈 Sea Level Predictor
🌊 Overview
This project develops a regression model to predict future global sea levels using historical data. Leveraging machine learning, it aims to provide crucial insights for climate change analysis and mitigation.

💡 Problem Statement
The goal is to accurately forecast global average sea level, focusing on handling time-series data anomalies, identifying trends, and building a robust predictive model.

📊 Data Source
Source: https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise

Description: Contains cumulative changes in global sea levels from 1880 to 2013, based on tide gauge and satellite measurements.

🚀 Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Loading, cleaning, and ensuring data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing historical trends (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to identify patterns. Insights showed an accelerating trend in sea level rise post-1990.

Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features like polynomial terms.

Model Training: Implementing a Linear Regression model (or your chosen model like Polynomial Regression, ARIMA) on split data.

Prediction & Evaluation: Forecasting future levels and evaluating performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.

🎯 Results & Visualizations
